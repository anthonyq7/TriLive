# TriLive

TriLive is a real-time iOS transit tracker that shows live bus & train ETAs, lets you bookmark favorites, search by location, and works offline. Built as a summer project by Anthony “Ant” Qin and Brian Maina "B.M.M", we plan to deploy it as an App Store release. Powered by SwiftUI + Core Location and a Docker-containerized FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis backend.

## Overview

TriLive delivers live transit ETAs for buses and trains at nearby stops in a sleek SwiftUI interface. We paired a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL for persistence and Redis for low-latency caching, all orchestrated via Docker Compose to guarantee “it works on my machine” parity.

---

## Features

- **Live ETAs** auto-refresh every 30 seconds (configurable)  
- **Offline Caching**: last-seen data available when offline  
- **Favorites**: bookmark your go-to routes and stops  
- **Location-Aware Search** via Core Location & autocomplete  
- **Health Checks** and autogenerated API docs with OpenAPI  

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI, Combine, Core Location, XCTest  
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Uvicorn  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL  
- **Cache**: Redis  
- **Containers**: Docker & Docker Compose  


## Production

### Prerequisites

- macOS with **Xcode 13+**  
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**  
- (Optional) **Python 3.10+** for manual backend runs

### Backend + Frontend Intergration

Our Dockerized FastAPI backend (Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Alembic) runs on Render with managed PostgreSQL and Redis, automatically building and deploying on each push to main. The SwiftUI front end calls the secure HTTPS JSON API for live ETAs, favorites syncing, and location-aware search.

## Design Assets
See TriLive Mockups.pdf in the repo root for UI/UX wireframes and flow diagrams.
